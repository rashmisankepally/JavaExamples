Write a class that excepts two generic arguments that are commonly typed and which mainly
create domain objects with those types, like a container that can contain any item.

Write a program for bounded generics like T Extends Car and allows multiple sub-type cars
to be passed and print pretty report for all the cars. Try to also create a class that uses
generics of generics.

Write a program that expects any Collection and sums up all the values in the collection if
it is number or concat all Strings if it is a string.
